            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Is the camera feasible and does it have potential use cases?</h5>
            <p class='lead'>Can a cheap 32x24 pixel thermal camera be used to detect heating of critical systems? Where might it be useful? These were the main questions UnSeen Technologies wanted to answer.</p> <p class='lead'>I prefer working from a starting point where nothing has been decided yet, but in this case we didn't have a clearly formulated hypothesis. We weren't trying to solve a problem, instead we wanted to test the feasibility of a novel solution to heat monitoring on the cheap.</p><p class='lead'>Therefore, a "ducktape and bubble gum" -type of prototype was quickly put together in order to test the technical capability of the cheap thermal camera in the the field.</p>

            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Power station visits</h5>
            <p class='lead'>I took the prototype to a power station, where over-heating of systems can cause severe impacts to the power supply. But first I had to get licensed for Occupational safety (FI: Työturvallisuuskortti) and The Red cross first response (FI: Hätäensiapu). </p><p class='lead'>While testing the feasibility, I used the opportunity to interview an expert about current ways to monitor the systems. After which, it was clear that there aren't many ways and the ways used are very resource heavy.</p>
            <p class='lead'>Visiting once isn't usually enough. For this project I visited multiple power stations to understand how they differ and how they are similar. Power stations aren't accessible to just anyone, therefore it was upto me to bring the insight back to office. Based on the gathered information we were able to iterate the prototype.</p>

            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Eventually we added the possibility of wireless transfer of data</h5>
            <p class='lead'>The first wireless version was straight up, bulky. Nevertheless, it was the cheapest wireless thermal camera system we knew and it worked. We were able to receive thermal images and normal images for months, with a single battery. This version wasn't even optimized for power consumption and it used a normal 4G modem to send data. Setup was also easier than originally expected, therefore we could go on to build the next version, which would again test the technical feasibility of the NB-IoT platform we had been developing.</p>

	            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Current situation</h5>
	            <p class='lead'>The latest version of the thermal cam uses the NB-IoT network, which is a low power and low speed network used for long distance data transmissions using very little power in relation to other mobile networks. The version is also very compact and can be easily put to various places. </p><p class='lead'>The current prototype has several usability issues which need to be tackled, but real world test can never the less be performed to give further insight. Work is still ongoing.</p>
