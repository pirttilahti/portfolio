            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Extensive usage scenario exploration was used</h5>
            <p class='lead'>In order to understand what our solution would need we analyzed the current scenarios involved with visiting restaurants. We realized the customer isn't always aware of how full the restaurant is, just by walking in. It is upto the waiters to notice new customers walking into a restaurant and point them towards available tables. In addition, some restaurants expect the customer to find their seat on their own and there can be multiple floors available for seating. There seemed to be a clear problem.</p>

            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Using cheap technology solutions already available we created our prototype</h5>
            <p class='lead'>Our solution was to build a system that recognizes the amount of customers entering, leads them to click on a screen, which then leads them to choose an available table. After this the customer can easily find the specific table in the restaurant by looking for a light above their table.</p>
            <p class='lead'>Technology used:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Touchscreen with a custom made prototype UI for user interaction</li>
              <li>Microsoft kinect for recognizing and counting users entering</li>
              <li>Prototype light guide built of a rasperry pi, led light, and a usb camera</li>
