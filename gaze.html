              <h5 class='featurette-heading'>What was done</h5>
              <p class='lead'>To evaluate the user experience of an augmented reality application used for remote collaboration/ assisting, I created a new method of evaluating user experience using gaze tracking and retrospective think-aloud. This project was part of my Masters thesis, however my thesis does not cover the benefits my project had for Delta Cygni Labs.</p>

              <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Use of gaze has its challenges</h5>
              <p class='lead'>To over come the problems involved with using gaze tracking and the nature of user experience a novel approach had to be taken. Gaze cannot tell whether the user likes something, despite some potential indicators like forelonged attention. Therefore, another measurement tool was needed. Thanks to my research background I was able to come up with a solution which enabled me to both harness the powerful method of gaze tracking and measure user experience all in the same testing time.</p>

              <h5 class='featurette-heading'>The benefit to the client</h5>
              <p class='lead'>The client was enable to pinpoint the best parts of their product and find the parts of their product that negatively affect the user experience of the client with great accuracy. Both those the client recognizes and those that they don't recognize affecting their judgement.</p>
              <p class='lead'>In addition, to the benefit gained from user insight during the interview process of the method, the client also got a list of usability issues. It is important to notice that despite the goal of gathering user experience data some potential experience affecting issues can be fixed via finding usability issues in the products..</p>
