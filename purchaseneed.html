            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Challenge</h5>
           <p class='lead'>When you think about buying, it doesn’t feel like something that is hard to do. All of us buy things, all the time. Purchasing or procurement as a profession, that is another story.
           </p> 
           <p class='lead'>
            Many might not realize, but manufacturing and wholesale companies usually need a separate role for purchasing. This role might focus solely on procurement. Why? Well knowing where to buy, what to buy, when to buy and how much can be bought or what is an optimal amount to buy, involves A LOT of work. Especially when it comes to solutions that are available widely.
           </p>
           <p class='lead'>
            As part of our research we noticed an opportunity, material need at different time intervals is really hard to manage.
           </p>
          
<br>
      
          
            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Research</h5>
             <p class='lead'>We were originally conducting generative research while trying to understand the limits of our solution regarding production and production planning when we noticed an apparent opportunity we hadn’t anticipated. When looking at how small or medium sized companies operate, purchasing is one of the most important things they do in manufacturing.
              </p>
                <p class='lead'>When companies manufacture, they also need to buy materials. When you manufacture a chair, you need wood, glue,  screws, and varnish. If you don’t have something, you won’t be finishing the product. Imagine building 50 types of chairs with unique types of wood and screws... You’re probably starting to get the problem. At this point we only knew that they need materials and that is what others solution providers are doing, listing the amounts needed.
             </p>
             <p class='lead'>Through multiple mentions of timing the purchase, I created a very rough sketch of a solution idea where we showed the material need for the current week. We took it to customers to help us pin down the real problem.
            </p>
           <p class='lead'>During factory visits, one of our customers mentioned a key insight: 
            </p>
             <p class='lead'>“We need to know 3 months in advance what materials we need. If our materials aren’t there at that time, we aren’t making the product”
              </p>
              <p class='lead'>
                We were able to take this insight and turn it into one of the main differentiating functionalities in our product.
              </p>
              <br>
            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Mapping the experience</h5>
             <p class='lead'>After user interviews and factory visits, we didn’t have it all laid out and ready to go, but through understanding the whole flow of production and materials, we were able to iterate on the original idea.
              </p>
              <p class='lead'>
                I dove deep into what happens and when and what needs to be known at which stage. Mapping the experience along the way to finally arrive with an idea.
              </p>
              <p class='lead'>
                The key was to understand that a week is nothing. Very few factories can suddenly get products delivered for friday if they realize the need on wednesday, thursday, or even monday. Most will have to order it at least a week before.
              </p>
          <br>
          
              <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Design & prototyping</h5>
              <p class='lead'>The sketch was iterated and the idea of showing days was switched to weeks. This small change, changed the game.
                </p>
              <p class='lead'>
                Now we had a solution that made a good start, useful. Planning is what procurement is about. Well at least after the sourcing is done. What was left, was user testing.
                </p>   

             <p class='lead'>As always, there were issues with the initial usability testing. But they were minor. 100% of the users understood the benefit of the solution and many found it a novel approach.
              <p class='lead'>
                To this day I don’t know of anyone else who has the same approach.
              </p>
<br>
                <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Outcome & learnings</h5>
                <p class="lead" style="font-weight:500">Customers got a novel way of approaching purchase need, changing the situation from needing someone who is always up-to-date on each item to simply telling users what to focus on. It also highlighted what else needs to be done to improve the overall product.</p>
                <br>
                <p class='lead'>“I can already say that it is good, because it reminded me that I forgot to order some bolts and screws”</p>
                <p class='lead'>- Positively surprised user, during test launch</p>
                <br>
                <p class='lead'> Despite figuring out a novel way and creating immediate benefit to customers as highlighted by the quote, the first iteration wasn’t an immediate success. It showed us that there are other problems with our product that cause the new solution to work haphazardly depending on how the rest of the product is being used.</p> 
                <p class='lead'> Luckily this was an issue which could be fixed. The outcome not only made it possible for users to shift their way of working, but also pin pointed other issues with our product logic that had gone unnoticed previously.</p>
                <p class='lead'> I’m a strong believer in the fact that failure or problems can move us forward and failure shouldn’t be avoided. Fail fast - something to live by in product development. Of course it helps keep up the motivation when some things work.</p>
                <p class='lead'>  When it comes to the feature, we are still working iteratively to make the feature better one step at a time.</p>
