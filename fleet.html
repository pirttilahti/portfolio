            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Fleet service reborn</h5>
            <p class='lead'>A customer of mine had been experimenting on a novel concept for fleet management. It hadn't taken off and they were looking to spice up their UI. As usual, this isn't what the client actually needed. The project started me on an exploration of the logistics industry in Finland and eventually led me to re-imagine the whole digital service around the business. The details of the service, however are protected by NDA and so are the actual products. To clarify, my part in the project was to reinvent the new concept around the digital service and build prototypes that could be developed.</p>

            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>User research</h5>
            <p class='lead'>The work started with understanding the customers business. What exactly they were trying to accomplish and how the challenge could be reframed to reimagine the future of fleet service. Drivers and customers are at the forefront of the logistics business, therefore understanding their need was of highest importance, since so far the exploration had been only about the obvious needs of business to cut costs and make more money, the usual story.</p><p class='lead'>Before doing anything else, I set out to inspect the actual workers, those doing the work. The drivers and the logistics co-ordinators. Just by shadowing the work, one could see many areas which had been the same for years and years. Some things were done, because things had always been done. The observation created tons of insight into the everyday working life of the people. Things so obvious to the industry that they wouldn't even mention it. The obvious things are the best insights. Assumptions that have lived forever are gold mines for user research. Sometimes finding an alternative is easy, sometimes it quickly becomes clear why they are assumptions. Changing those ways however is usually where you make the largest impact.</p>

            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Analysis</h5>
            <p class='lead'>Gathering insight is only the first part. Understanding the bigger picture is as essential to great innovations. Insights that aren't aligned easily sway you toward your personal opinions. Therefore, no matter how tempting it is to make quick assumptions based on gathered insights, it is always beneficial to map them out.</p> 
            <p class='lead'>When I talk about mapping out, I don't necessarily mean making a map or even a user journey map. I mean making multiple models based on different perspectives. Organising the notes however, needs to be done first. So what I usually do, as with this project as well, I make an affinity diagram. By arranging the notes into themes, I can easily find the insight I've recorded and use it in understanding the case.</p>
              <p class='lead'>Finally I made multiple different models based on the information perspectives that I wanted to understand. With models it is important to choose the appropriate ones for your specific case. Other models aren't necessary bad, but with experience one learns to pick the most appropriate ones for any specific case.</p>

            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Ideation</h5>
            <p class='lead'>To clarify, at this point, due to NDA reasons, I'm mainly showing the process of designing the dashboard. It actually is the most generic part of the service. However, up until this point, many of the things done have built on top of each other. This is the part where the products of the service start to separate. And from now on, I'll be talking mostly about the dashboard part of the service which was most generic so as not to give out information under the NDA.</p>
            <p class='lead'> At this point I started to develop some ideas of what the products could be like. This however, is the part where you challenge your own assumptions and first thoughts. So I started by doing some competitor analysis. I drew wireframes in my notebook and eventually was quite sure I'd like to approach the challenge with a general concept, which I sloppily made a digital drawings of. Now when I say sloppyly, my intention was to gather information and opinions from the client, not represent them with a solution. Therefore I've found that by making the first draft sloppily you gain much more feedback from the client about their ideas, but at the same time you get to represent your concept to them.</p>
            <p class='lead'>After receiving feedback from the client, the ideation went on another round. During the second round, I refined the look of the product and created a detailed information hierarchy to represent the interconnections of the information layout.</p>

            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Prototype and test</h5>
            <p class='lead'>After the second round of ideation, I was ready to build something to test. I carefully designed the first attempt at the UI. I built an interactive prototype using adobe XD which still didn't represent the refined look of the final prototype.</p>
            <p class='lead'>By having all the interactions in play, I could start testing the product. I took it to the users.</p>
            <p class='lead'>The users liked it, but there were some things that could be better. In fact they started to ask, when could the product be availble? Perfect! This just what we as designers want to hear. I returned to my working station and refined the prototype based on feedback.</p>
            <p class='lead'>At some point it became known, that the prototype was also to be used as advertisement aid. That is when I refined the visuals as well. And made a prototype based on protopie. The work eventually led to developer hand off and the development was handled by the client.</p>
