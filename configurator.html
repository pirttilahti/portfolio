            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Challenge</h5>
           <p class='lead'>I love a challenge like this one! This is a case where everyone gets it wrong in the beginning.
           </p> 
           <p class='lead'>
             ”We need a sales configurator!” Was what everyone was saying. Customers were asking to be able to sell their products in different, sizes, different colors, different shapes, with different materials, and so on. The sort of logical assumption then was: we need a sales configurator.
           </p>
           <p class='lead'>
            ”Look at how this and that web site does it”
           </p>
            <p class='lead'>
            The only problem was: we didn’t know what our customers wanted to configure in the sales configurator. And since we are the system that they keep their product information in, we also couldn’t just make a list. We had to find out what needs to be considered when making product variations for manufacturing.
           </p>
          
<br>
      
          
            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Research</h5>
             <p class='lead'>Going into the research I only knew that I couldn’t just make a sales configurator because there was nothing to connect to the configurator. The idea of a sales configurator for a single product is simple enough, but making a sales configurator for an unspecified product is another story.
              </p>
                <p class='lead'>So I started by gathering and interviewing companies that needed variations or configurations for their manufacturing. This was about as much as I knew at the time. I wanted to understand what companies were dealing with. Why were some of them asking for a configurator and what was hard about variation handling.
             </p>
             <p class='lead'>It turns out, everything.
            </p>
           <p class='lead'>What I quickly realized is, that some companies need to be able to handle simple variations, some need complex variations and some need both. 
            </p>
             <p class='lead'>The interviews (10 companies, both current and potential customers) generated a lot of data which was quite hard to organize into a coherent whole in ones head and that was also the reason everyone was wrong about what we actually needed. Luckily UX work never goes to the solution before exploring the data and analyzing the opportunities, so the next step as always, was to map the data.
              </p>
              <br>
            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Mapping the experience</h5>
             <p class='lead'>I used an affinity diagram to map out themes and made process maps from each companies approach to identify what is common and what is unique for each company.
              </p>
              <p class='lead'>
               For a manufacturing ERP that acts as a product information repository, it is not enough to know that the shirt can be blue or red. We also need to know that the shirt needs to have a red and blue color dye used and in order to track how much we have and how many shirts we can color with the dye, we need to connect the variant to the material used.
              </p>
              <p class='lead'>
                I ended up with 4 different patterns used by companies to create variations from their products. I then created processes based on these patterns and also mapped the terminology so that everyone in the team understands the differences between configuration, configuring, configurator, variations, etc. This part isn’t something I usually do, but in order get a common language it needed to be laid out, since slight variations in word form would mean going from the act of setting up a configuration to having a ready configuration, etc.
              </p>
          <br>
           <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Opportunity mapping</h5>
              <p class='lead'>After laying everything out, we had to make some decisions. We used opportunity mapping to identify different opportunities from our refined goal, and experiments we wanted to test (ie. hypotheses to be tested). This part was facilitated by me, but the outcome was heavily influenced by those taking part in workshops that I held to align the team.
                </p>
              <p class='lead'>
                The outcome was OK, it goes to show that doing something that people are not familiar with doesn’t always work out as imagined, but in the end those with the most say: the Product manager & technical architect were at least on board with the direction we wanted to go in.
                </p>   

            
<br>
              <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Design & prototyping</h5>
              <p class='lead'>Based on the selected opportunities and hypotheses, I did a lot of ideation around specific parts of the interactions.
                </p>
              <p class='lead'>
                After doing this, I created 4 different prototypes to test out different scenarios from basic to more advanced. This was done, because for some customers basic was enough and some needed advanced handling to get any benefit from the configurations. The different prototypes were:
                </p>   

             <p class='lead'>Simple variations, Complex variations with substructures Variations with free form dimensions Sales configurator
              <p class='lead'>
               Each test scenario was tailored to companies. It made no sense to test if a clothing company could figure out how to use exact measurements for furniture in their product configurations, etc. Those were not users for the solution.
              </p>
                        <p class='lead'>
               Instead I used my prior knowledge of the companies to tailor a testing session for them to use 1 or more of the prototypes.
              </p>
                        <p class='lead'>
               This was quite a heavy setup, but sometimes it is necessary. It also gave me the opportunity to test out different lifecycles of product development, the most advanced being the last to be developed.
              </p>
<br>
                <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Outcome & learnings</h5>
                <p class="lead" style="font-weight:500">What started out as an ask for a sales configurator, ended up with a plan for a sales configurator and 3 things that were harder than the sales configurator, and an understanding why we can’t just jump to a sales configurator.</p>
                <br>
                <p class='lead'>This was the first time I actually designed a tool for users. This realization came to me afterwards. Usually we talk about every software being a tool, but the separation of e.g. Figma were craft plays a role and a typical SAAS product is something we don’t usually consider a lot. Through this development the separation has become more clear to me. Using a typical SAAS wrong, will lead you with useless results, While using a tool wrong, will generate creative or outcomes. Not saying that they are always good outcomes, but they might not be objectively wrong.</p>
                <p class='lead'>With a typical SAAS the user will start using the product wrong to overcome short comings, where as with a tool, the user can start using the tool in unexpected ways and still use it correctly.</p>
                <br>
                <p class='lead'>This was one of the most challenging projects I’ve encountered and it really made me push myself to think outside the box. However the confidence level I have that the decisions I made are right, are far greater with this one than many other projects. Not to say that I usually make ill informed decisions. With this project there were multiple opportunities to think different and actually create novel solutions.</p> 
                <p class='lead'>That being said, unfortunately, we are yet to actually build the solution, because of thing unrelated to my work, so I can’t say for sure that this fixed everything for the users, etc. ;) </p>
