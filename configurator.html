  <h4 class="section-title">Design team of one: facilitating successful discovery.</h4>
   <p class='lead'>Finland is a very engineering-oriented country. As a result, it's quite common for products to have just one designer. That’s also the case for our young ERP.
   <p class='lead'>A setup like this calls for a strategic, outcome-oriented approach. There were a lot of strings to hold together. This project is a good example of a case where solving the problem is what really matters, not the visuals. </p>

            <h6 class="method-title">CHALLENGE</h6>
            <h4 class="section-title">"We need a sales configurator!"</h4>
           <p class='lead'>That was what everyone was saying. Customers wanted to sell products in different sizes, colors, shapes, materials; all kinds of combinations. The logical next step: Build a sales configurator. Sure, I’ll just collect my your sales and configure them, wait what? </p> 
           <p class='lead'>
            Manufacturing ERPs come with their own unique headaches. One of the hardest to solve is connecting material requirements to product variations. It sounds simple at first. But the more you think about it, the messier it gets. Usually, that complexity lives in one person’s head. Often the one who's been there the longest. Not exactly scalable. </p>
           <p class='lead'>
            I love a challenge like this one. It's the kind where everyone starts off heading in the wrong direction. The problem wasn’t what the brief was about. *Rips brief*
           </p>
            <p class='lead'>
              The real issue was, we didn’t actually know what our customers wanted to configure. And since we're the system where they keep their product data, we couldn’t just get the variations and details from somewhere else. We had to figure out what actually needs to be considered when making product variations for manufacturing. </p>

            <h6 class="method-title">RESEARCH</h6>
            <h4 class="section-title">What was difficult about handling variations? It turns out, everything.</h4>
             <p class='lead'>Going into the research, the only thing I knew for sure was that I couldn’t just build a sales configurator. There was nothing to connect it to. A configurator for a single, well-defined product is simple enough. But a configurator for an unspecified product? That’s a whole different story.</p>
                <p class='lead'>So I started by reaching out to companies that needed product variations or configurations in their manufacturing. I set up interviews to understand what they were actually dealing with. Why were some asking for a configurator?</p>
             <p class='lead'>Some companies only needed simple variations. Some needed complex ones. And some needed both, at the same time.
            </p>
           <p class='lead'>I spoke with 10 companies, a mix of current and potential customers, and gathered a lot of insights. Way too much to keep straight in your head. And that was part of the problem. That’s why everyone had the wrong idea about what we actually needed.</p>
             <p class='lead'>Luckily, UX work doesn’t jump straight to solutions. It starts with the data. The next step, as always, was to map what we had and look for patterns. </p>

              <h6 class="method-title">MAPPING THE EXPERIENCE</h6>
              <h4 class="section-title">To make sense of everything, I started with an affinity diagram to map out themes across the interviews.</h4>
             <p class='lead'>Then I created process maps for each company's approach, to see what was common and what was unique.</p>
              <p class='lead'>
                For a manufacturing ERP that also serves as a product information repository, it's not enough to know that a shirt can be blue or red. We also need to know that red and blue dye is required, and how much of it is available. If we want to track inventory accurately and calculate how many shirts we can produce, the product variant needs to be connected to the materials used.</p>
              <p class='lead'>
                I ended up with 4 different patterns used by companies to create variations from their products. I then created processes based on these patterns and also mapped the terminology so that everyone in the team understands the differences between configuration, configuring, configurator, variations, etc. This part isn’t something I usually do, but in order get a common language it needed to be laid out, since slight variations in word form would mean going from the act of setting up a configuration to having a ready configuration, etc.</p>

          <h6 class="method-title">OPPORTUNITY MAPPING</h6>
            <h4 class="section-title">We used opportunity mapping to define possible directions based on our refined goals and to outline experiments we wanted to run.</h4>
              <p class='lead'>I facilitated this part, but the outcomes were shaped by the people in the room. I ran workshops to align the team, and the input from those sessions played a big role in where we ended up.</p>
              <img class='case-image' src='img/opportunitymapping.png' alt='opportunity map'></img>
              <p class="img-description">Example of goals we explored</p>
              <p class='lead'>
                The result? It was OK. This kind of process doesn’t always go exactly as imagined, especially when it's unfamiliar to the team. But in the end, the people with the most influence, the Product Manager and the Technical Architect were on board with the direction. That was what mattered.

            <h6 class="method-title">IDEATION</h6>
            <h4 class="section-title">Based on the selected opportunities and hypotheses, thorough ideation sessions around specific parts of the interactions were conducted.</h4>
              <p class='lead'>Before hopping onto prototyping, I explored different scenarios and ideated around different processes. For some processes it was beneficial to draw out the process, for some it was more beneficial to focus on an individual interaction. I sketched out some potential solutions, but quickly moved on before getting stuck on any one idea.
              </p>
              <p class='lead'>The result was, well from an outsiders view, chaotic. from a designers view: ideation done right. The point in ideation is to explore everything even seemingly bad ideas. Some of the best ideas come from the worst possible ideas.
              </p>
              <p class='lead'>Eventually I landed on a group of approaches that fit together fit every scenario. At which point I progressed into prototyping.
              </p>

            <h6 class="method-title">PROTOTYPING</h6>
              <h4 class="section-title">It was clear that one scenario was not enough to tackle all the different company types, so I designed multiple test cases.</h4>
             <p class='lead'>I created four different prototypes to test a range of scenarios, from basic to more advanced. Some customers only needed simple variation handling, while others required more complex solutions to get any real benefit. The four prototypes were:</p>

              <ol>
                <li>Simple variations</li>
                <li>Complex variations with substructures</li>
                <li>Variations with free-form dimensions</li>
                <li>Sales configurator</li>
              </ol>

              <p class='lead'>
                Each test scenario was tailored to the company. It didn’t make sense to test whether a clothing company could work with exact measurements for furniture. That wasn’t their world, and they weren’t the users we were designing for.
              </p>
              <p class='lead'>
                  Instead, I used what I already knew about each company to create focused test sessions. Some used one prototype, others tested several.
              </p>
              <p class='lead'>
                It was a heavy setup, but sometimes that’s what it takes. It also gave me the chance to test out different product lifecycle models, with the most advanced scenarios developed last.

                <h6 class="method-title">OUTCOMES AND LEARNINGS</h6>
                <h4 class="section-title">What started out as an ask for a sales configurator, ended up with a plan for a sales configurator and 3 things that were harder than the sales configurator, and an understanding why we can’t just jump to a sales configurator.</h4>
                <div class="outcomes-container">
                  <div class="outcome-box">
                    <h3>🎯</h3>
                    <h6>Designed a solution that 90% of the participating companies felt could directly address their variation-related challenges.</h6>

                    <h3>💰</h3>
                    <h6>Helped the product team save development resources by clarifying the full scope early, which allowed us to re-evaluate the effort before committing to implementation.</h6>
                  </div>
                 </div>
                <br>
                <p class='lead'>We created a plan for a sales configurator, yes, but also with three other pieces that turned out to be more complex than the configurator itself. And a shared understanding of why we couldn’t just jump straight into building one.</p>
                <p class='lead'>It was only afterwards that I realized this was the first time I had actually designed a tool for users. We often say all software is a tool, but there’s a difference between something like Figma, where craft plays a role, and a typical SaaS product. That distinction became a lot clearer to me through this work. If you use a typical SaaS product the wrong way, you usually get broken or useless results. But with a tool, using it "wrong" can still lead to creative or interesting outcomes. Not always good ones, but not objectively incorrect either. With most SaaS products, users start working around limitations by misusing features. With a real tool, users can push the boundaries and still stay within the intended space. That’s a meaningful difference.</p>
              
                <p class='highlight' >This was one of the most challenging projects I’ve worked on. It pushed me to think differently, to really question assumptions, and to design beyond what was asked. And while I don’t always walk away from a project feeling this level of clarity, I’m more confident in the decisions made here than in many others. Not because I usually make bad decisions, but because this time, there were more chances to truly explore and create something novel.</p> 
                <p class='lead'>That said, the solution hasn’t actually been built yet, therefore I'm left waiting for the right moment to work with the development team to implement this along taking into account some of the findings from the user testing of the prototypes. </p>
