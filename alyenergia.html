      <h6 class='method-title'>Role</h6>
      <p class='section-title'>Through out the years I have been the only designer on the project, working as a consultant.</p>
      <p class="lead"> I have been responsible for the user experience, user interface and visual design of the application. I have also been responsible for the user research and user testing.</p> 
      <p class="lead">All of this, I've done as a side hustle.
      </p> 
          
            <h6 class='method-title'>Challenge</h6>
           <p class='section-title'>Back in 2020 the market was quite different regarding the electricity market in Finland. Electricity was cheap. No one really cared how much they use or what the price is. However, a service to show your consumption was expected.
           </p> 
           <p class='lead'>
            My client contacted me, to help him build the best electricity app in Finland. That was his ambition from the start. His vision was to grow the central business with the clear message: we offer smart electricity (älyenergia) and this app is the perfect example. In other words, he wanted the app to be what separated his company from the bulk.</p>
           </p>
           <p class='lead'>
            ”How do we do that, can you help us?” Yes!</p>
           </p>
          
<br>
      
          
            <h6 class='method-title'>Early research</h6>
            <h4 class='section-title'>What about electricity matters to a normal household? Turns out most people don't think about their electricity usage, before it start to cost.</h4>
             <p class='lead'>To start off, I knew next to nothing about the electricity market. Well, I personally wanted my bill to be as small as possible without doing much. Good start? No.
             </p>
                <p class='lead'>We started by collecting workshopping around what we know. What we expect, what do we think we know about users and what the business needs. This gave us a starting point.</p>
             </p>
             <p class='lead'>After I designed a semi-structured interview script and plan for user research and contacted 10 different users to tell me about their experience in using electricity, tracking it and paying for it. The selection was based on the expected user groups with different stages in life.</p>
            </p>
            <img class='case-image' src='img/customerproblem2.png' alt='interview'></img>
            <br>

            <br>

            <h6 class='method-title'>MAPPING INITIAL EXPERIENCE</h6>
           <h4 class='section-title'>I presented insights that challenged the company's initial assumptions. I mapped the user experience from multiple perspectives, identifying both short-term improvements and long-term strategic opportunities for the application.
           </h4>
           <p class='lead'>I organized and analyzed notes in order to thematized insights from user interviews to uncover what truly matters to users. This led to the creation of 5 user personas which some what aligned, but also gave another perspective to the companies understanding of their customers and soon to be users.</p>
           <p class="lead">This was the first round of user research which focused on qualitative research, after which the application started generating qualitative data that has been used mostly since the first round.</p>
            </div> 
          <div class='case-image-container'>

            <h6 class='method-title'>EARLY DESIGN</h6>
             <h4 class='section-title'>After understanding that we need to focus on getting some of the key information to the users, we agreed we can move on. </h4>
             <p class="lead">I started making early wireframes and worked out the user flows as well as an early information hierarchy for the app. </p>
             <p class="lead">In hindsight, it would’ve been a good opportunity to do user testing at this point, but I was in a project delivery mindset at the time with a limited budget and time. Instead we did a lot of internal discussing on what our capabilities and ambitions are.
            </p> 
             <p class='lead'>

                Before doing high fidelity prototypes we created a enhanced color scheme and look & feel for the brand. Not my specialty, but I was able to bring them up a notch. 
              </p>
              <p class='lead'>
                We created the original prototype, which wasn't really used as a prototype but a specification, based on an elevated visual design from what the company had at the time. It was used to create the first version of the app. Wrong features were prioritized in the beginning and we used development resources to fail, not so fast. The initial ratings of the app was around 3.2/5. Not bad, but not great.</p>
              </p>
            </div>

            </div>
        
          <br>
            <h6 class='method-title'>MORE RESEARCH</h6>
             <h4 class='section-title'>I was very limited with my time at this point. Doing this while working full time at another company. We decided to make a user survey, since we already had around 1000 users.
             </h4>
              <p class='lead'>
                “The app is nice, but...” Was what we got a lot. Luckily, we had a high occurrence of issues in similar areas. The company analyzed the data and came up with some occuring themes.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                It was great to see that the company was able to analyze the data so that I didn't need to spend time doing the original weeding. This was a good start, but we needed more.</p>
              </p>
              <img class='case-image' src='img/customerproblem.png' alt='interview'></img>
              <br>
  
              <br>
          <br>
          
          <h6 class='method-title'>More mapping</h6>
              <h4 class='section-title'>I set out to explore how this would reshape our understanding.
              </h4>
              <p class='lead'>
                  I did not scrap what I already knew. I knew, that I should know about 80% of the most important things, so adding to what I knew was the best way forward. This meant that I was able to do tweaks to the expectations and correct some assumptions.
                </p>   
                <p class="lead">
                  We were able to prioritize the issues and create a list of things that needed design. This was a good start, but we needed more.</p>
                </p>
                <p class='lead'>
                 Some of the prioritzed items that made most impact were:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>TODO: We needed to calculate the estimated monthly bill for the user. Including historical information.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>TODO: We needed to create an algorithm that analyzes what electricity appliances were on. And what appliance uses most electricity.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>TODO: We needed to introduce smart appliances like electric vehicle and HVAC control to the app</li>
                </ul>
<br>
            <h6 class='method-title'>DISCUSSING AND PROTOTYPING</h6>
             <h4 class='section-title'>I was lucky that the client already knew what design can do, so discussions weren’t arguments. Instead they were feedback sessions and co-creation opportunities. Therefore, we ended up with good ideas.
</h4>              
<p class='lead'>
  These insights were translated into prototypes and handed off to development, who had been closely involved throughout the design discussions.
              </p>
              <p class='lead'>
                This brought us to 4.0/5 ratings in a few months while downloads kept increasing.</p>
              </p>
            </div>

        </div>
          <h6 class='method-title'>Continuous improvement</h6>
           <h4 class='section-title'>Through the multiple years, we have transferred the development and design efforts towards continuous improvements.</h4> 
           <p class="lead">We collect comments from customers and do at least an annual user survey. 
          </p>
            <p class="lead">With surveys, we are always able to increase the rating 0.1/5, because the amount of feedback we get is numerous. Very different from B2B side, which I have most experience from. We have more ambitious ideas in the pipeline, but we are already quite happy with the current apps standing.
            </p>
<br>
        <h6 class='method-title'>Outcomes and learnings</h6>
                <h4 class="section-title">We’ve positioned ourselves as a "David" taking on industry Goliaths. Our ratings are climbing, and competitors are beginning to follow our lead. The future is ours to shape.</h4>
                <div class="outcomes-container">
                  <div class="outcome-box">

                    <h3>🎯</h3>
                    <h6>Instead of serving as a marketing vehicle, as is common in the electricity sector, the application was purposefully designed to prioritize user needs.</h6>
                  </div>
                  <div class="outcome-box">
                    <h3>💬</h3>
                    <h6>Created an environment for product led growth rallied around the application that has grown to employee a dedicated team of product people. (Altough I'm still the only designer.)</h6>
                  </div>
                  <div class="outcome-box">
                    <h3>💰</h3>
                    <h6>We have overtaken large companies with bigger budgets, helped grow the business recurring revenue by millions per year, with most of the marketing effort going toward the app. </h6>
                  </div>
                 </div>
                <br>
                <p class='lead'>We have been going side to side with one of the largest Finnish electricity providers in app store ratings. Sometimes we are the highest rated, sometimes they are. Usually by a lead of 0.1/5. This I believe is the best objective measure of success of the application.</p>
                <p class='lead'>However, when it comes to UX this has been an amazing opportunity for me to hone the other side of software development B2C. My expertise is in B2B, and these two differ from what the users expect and what the opportunities for research are.</p>
                <p class='lead'> B2C has more quantitative data available and should be used much more than in the B2B side, where it is also important. On the B2C side however, gathering qualitative data can be dangerous if you pick the wrong users to ask from. They can literally represent a thousandth of a per cent. Even if you 20 users, they might still represent less than 1% of the user base.</p> 
                <p class='lead'> Nevertheless, this effort spanning years has from my perspective highlighted my ability to adjust to different situations and use my design capabilities in very different situations and that is what I want to highlight.</p>
              </div>
              <p class="highlight">I'm currently working on the next iteration of the visual design language for the updated brand. The new visual design hasn't been published yet, so the visual design you see, is from 2021-ish.</p>
