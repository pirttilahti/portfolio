            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Challenge</h5>
           <p class='lead'>Back in 2020 the market was quite different regarding the electricity market in Finland. Electricity was cheap. No one really cared how much they use or what the price is. However, a service to show your consumption was expected.
           </p> 
           <p class='lead'>
            My client contacted me, to help him build an app for his company that would become the best in Finland. That was his ambition. He wanted this app to grow his whole business.</p>
           </p>
           <p class='lead'>
            ”How do we do that, can you help us?” Yes!</p>
           </p>
          
<br>
      
          
            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Early research</h5>
             <p class='lead'>To start of, I knew next to nothing about the electricity market. Well, I personally wanted my bill to be as small as possible without doing much. Good start? No.
              </p>
                <p class='lead'>We started by collecting workshopping around what we know. What we expect, what do we think we know about users and what the business needs. This gave us a starting point.</p>
             </p>
             <p class='lead'>After I designed a semi-structured interview script and plan for user research and contacted 10 different users to tell me about their experience in using electricity, tracking it and paying for it. The selection was based on the expected user groups with different stages in life.</p>
            </p>
            <br>

        

            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Mapping the initial experience</h5>
           <p class='lead'>I worked toward thematizing the notes from the user interviews and understood what really matters to users. I created personas which differed slightly from what the company thought. I mapped the experience in various ways to understand different view points and came up with short term opportunities and long term opportunities for the application.
            </p>

        <hr class='featurette-divider'>

        
          <div class='leadtext'>
            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Initial design & prototyping</h5>
             <p class='lead'>After presenting the finding we agreed we can move on. I started making early wireframes and worked out the user flows as well as an early information hierarchy for the app. In hindsight, it would’ve been a good opportunity to do user testing at this point, but I was in a project delivery mindset at the time with a limited budget and time. Instead we did a lot of internal discussing on what our capabilities and ambitions are.
              </p>
              <p class='lead'>
                Before doing high fidelity prototypes we created a enhanced color scheme and look & feel for the brand. Not my specialty, but I was able to bring them up a notch. 
              </p>
              <p class='lead'>
                We created the original prototype and it was used to create the first version of the app. Wrong features were prioritized in the beginning and we used development resources to fail fast. The initial ratings of the app was around 3.2/5. Not bad, but not great.</p>
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class='case-image-container'>
              <img class='case-image' src='img/alyenergiadesign1.png' alt='draft'/>
            </div>
        
          <div class='leadtext'>
            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>More research</h5>
             <p class='lead'>I was very limited with my time at this point. Doing this while working full time at another company. We decided to make a user survey, since we already had around 1000 users.
              </p>
              <p class='lead'>
                “The app is nice, but...” Was what we got a lot. Luckily, we had a high occurrence of issues in similar areas. The company analyzed the data and came up with some occuring themes.
              </p>
          <br>
          
              <h5 class='featurette-heading'>More mapping</h5>
              <p class='lead'>How does this change the understanding, is what I wanted to answer.
                </p>
              <p class='lead'>
                  I did not scrap what I already knew. I knew, that I should know about 80% of the most important things, so adding to what I knew was the best way forward. This meant that I was able to do tweaks to the expectations and correct some assumptions.
                </p>   
<br>
            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Discussing and prototyping</h5>
             <p class='lead'>I was lucky that the client already knew what design can do, so discussions weren’t arguments. Instead they were feedback sessions and co-creation opportunities. Therefore, we ended up with good ideas.
              <p class='lead'>
                These were transferred to the prototypes and handed over to development, that was always with us while discussing the designs.
              </p>
              <p class='lead'>
                This brought us to 4.0/5 ratings in a few months while downloads kept increasing.</p>
              </p>
            </div>
          <div class='case-image-container'>
            <img class='case-image' src='img/alyenergiadesign2.png' alt='draft'/>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="leadtext">
          <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Continuous improvement</h5>
           <p class='lead'>Through the multiple years, we have transferred the development and design efforts towards continuous improvements. We collect comments from customers and do at least an annual user survey. With surveys, we are always able to increase the rating 0.1/5, because the amount of feedback we get is numerous. Very different from B2B side, which I have most experience from. We have more ambitious ideas in the pipeline, but we are already quite happy with the current apps standing.
            </p>
<br>
                <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Outcome & learnings</h5>
                <p class="lead" style="font-weight:500">We have overtaken large companies with bigger budgets, helped grow the business recurring revenue by millions per year, with most of the marketing effort going toward the app. It translates into new customers for the main electricity selling business.</p>
              <p class='lead'>We have been going side to side with one of the largest Finnish electricity providers in app store ratings. Sometimes we are the highest rated, sometimes they are. Usually by a lead of 0.1/5. This I believe is the best objective measure of success of the application.</p>
                <p class='lead'>However, when it comes to UX this has been an amazing opportunity for me to hone the other side of software development B2C. My expertise is in B2B, and these two differ from what the users expect and what the opportunities for research are.</p>
                <p class='lead'> B2C has more quantitative data available and should be used much more than in the B2B side, where it is also important. On the B2C side however, gathering qualitative data can be dangerous if you pick the wrong users to ask from. They can literally represent a thousandth of a per cent. Even if you 20 users, they might still represent less than 1% of the user base.</p> 
                <p class='lead'> Nevertheless, this effort spanning years has from my perspective highlighted my ability to adjust to different situations and use my design capabilities in very different situations and that is what I want to highlight.</p>
