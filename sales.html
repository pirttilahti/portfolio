            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Challenge</h5>
           <p class='lead'>Working with a large enterprise software like Microsoft Dynamics, isn't always the easiest task for a UX designer. It includes a lot of compromises and continuous communication, both with the customer and the consultants that are necessary for understanding what can and should be done. The task at hand doesn't become easier when a lot of things have been decided by the enterprise software manufacturer prior to even starting the project.
           </p> 
           <p class='lead'>
            In this particular project, the customer (anonymous) wanted to simplify the creation and handling of sales orders, which were handled in Dynamics 365 (D365). The users had expressed their dissatisfaction with the new confusing UI of D365. They were used to working with the old Microsoft AX and the updated UI of 365 wasn't working for them. This is where UX is usually asked to step in, and so it was this time as well. (The picture shows the unmodified look of D365 F&O with dummy data)</p>

            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Research</h5>
             <p class='lead'>What do sales people actually do? Everyone knows what sales is. Everyone knows it involves a buyer and a vendor. When it comes to actually working in sales, people tend to have a lot of expectations and assumptions.
              </p>
                <p class='lead'>In order to find out what was actually happening, we started with a contextual inquiry by visiting the actual place where the sales people work. We saw that their tasks differed to some extend depending on their role, but most of them were receiving orders and keeping track of orders. We also noted things such as post'its everywhere and heaps of documents. And when the order was taken, paper was used instead of the actual system. Not due to time constraints, but ease of use. (Image not from actual inquiry, only illustration purposes)</p>

            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Mapping the experience</h5>
           <p class='lead'>We humans are interesting in many ways, especially when it comes to information processing. Usually we tend to think of ourselves as rational thinkers, but when it comes down to facts, rationality depends on the perspective. Mapping out the findings is always important, even if you think you got all the points from the interviews. By mapping information out on a paper, you start to see relationships that didn't exist in your mind. You might even start to doubt your first impressions, which is what should happen.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
            After mapping out what seemed like a very complex amount of things, we could easily narrow down the most important tasks at hand to taking orders and moving orders forward to be sent to the customers within a few days. So what was the problem?</p>
            </p>

          </div>

          <div class='leadtext'>
            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Design & prototyping</h5>
             <p class='lead'>Well, the complexity wasn't actually related to receiving orders per se, it was actually related to handling everything around it. Dynamics has been created for exactly that, but that is also visible to the user, all the time.
              </p>
              <p class='lead'>
              D365 is based on the idea that enterprises are complex environments with multiple ways of doing the same thing. As good an insight as this is from a technical perspective, the reality of the situation is actually quite different: enterprises are actually complex environments with unique ways of doing similar things. The unique part is what makes them competitive, the similar part makes them function.
              </p>
              <p class='lead'>
              At this point I took over the projects final design as the information gathering was a job for a two people, but working with the insight didn't require additional people. Therefore, I simplyfied the structure of D365 and made it appealing for the users and presented the first version, which we could start our development on. Starting development as quickly as possible isn't what I prefer doing, but at this point it was out of my hands and therefore I put together the main functionalities and a best guess of what could work.</p>

                    <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Outcome and learnings</h5>
                    <p class="lead" style="font-weight:500">The customer got a solution which was tailored to their need and used the solution internally as an example of how successful the whole multi-million project was.</p>
                  <p class='lead'>The project, however successful helped me figure out that I don’t want to keep on doing projects that ship without verification. The long term success remains a mystery to me and this was one of the final projects I never got to follow up on. Nowadays, I expect to continue the feedback loop even after a successful launch.</p>
                    <<p class='lead'>It also highlights the danger of visually appealing interfaces that mask the usability issues that might arise later. That being said, interfaces shouldn’t be ugly to counter this, just to keep it in mind while gathering feedback on the solution.</p>
                    <p class='lead'> Since this project, I’ve honed my capabilities with the feedback loop even after the initial launch.</p>
