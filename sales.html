            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Microsoft dynamics Finance and Operations - Yeah...</h5>
           <p class='lead'>Working with a large enterprise software like Microsoft Dynamics, isn't always the easiest task for a UX designer. It includes a lot of compromises and continuous communication, both with the customer and the consultants that are necessary for understanding what can and should be done. The task at hand doesn't become easier when a lot of things have been decided by the enterprise software manufacturer prior to even starting the project.</p> <p class='lead'> In this particular project, the customer (anonymous) wanted to simplify the creation and handling of sales orders, which were handled in Dynamics 365 (D365). The users had expressed their dissatisfaction with the new confusing UI of D365. They were used to working with the old Microsoft AX and the updated UI of 365 wasn't working for them. This is where UX is usually asked to step in, and so it was this time as well. (The picture shows the unmodified look of D365 F&O with dummy data)</p>

            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>What do sales people actually do?</h5>
             <p class='lead'>Everyone knows what sales is. Everyone knows it involves a buyer and a vendor. When it comes to actually working in sales, people tend to have a lot of expectations and assumptions.</p><p class='lead'>In order to find out what was actually happening, we started with a contextual inquiry by visiting the actual place where the sales people work. We saw that their tasks differed to some extend depending on their role, but most of them were receiving orders and keeping track of orders. We also noted things such as post'its everywhere and heaps of documents. And when the order was taken, paper was used instead of the actual system. Not due to time constraints, but ease of use. (Image not from actual inquiry, only illustration purposes)</p>

            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Mapping it out</h5>
           <p class='lead'>We humans are interesting in many ways, especially when it comes to information processing. Usually we tend to think of ourselves as rational thinkers, but when it comes down to facts, rationality depends on the perspective. Mapping out the findings is always important, even if you think you got all the points from the interviews. By mapping information out on a paper, you start to see relationships that didn't exist in your mind. You might even start to doubt your first impressions, which is what should happen. </p>  <p class='lead'>After mapping out what seemed like a very complex amount of things, we could easily narrow down the most important tasks at hand to taking orders and moving orders forward to be sent to the customers within a few days. So what was the problem?</p>

            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Insights and sketching</h5>
             <p class='lead'>Well, the complexity wasn't actually related to receiving orders per se, it was actually related to handling everything around it. Dynamics has been created for exactly that, but that is also visible to the user, all the time.</p><p class='lead'> D365 is based on the idea that enterprises are complex environments with multiple ways of doing the same thing. As good an insight as this is from a technical perspective, the reality of the situation is actually quite different: enterprises are actually complex environments with unique ways of doing similar things. The unique part is what makes them competitive, the similar part makes them function.</p> <p class='lead'>At this point I took over the projects final design as the information gathering was a job for a two people, but working with the insight didn't require additional people. Therefore, I simplyfied the structure of D365 and made it appealing for the users and presented the first version, which we could start our development on. Starting development as quickly as possible isn't what I prefer doing, but at this point it was out of my hands and therefore I put together the main functionalities and a best guess of what could work.</p>

            <h5 class='featurette-heading'>Prototyping</h5>
           <p class='lead'>Nothing is finished after the first try. Therefore, when I had something to show, the users could be involved. There were many things, which I would've changed were it a completely custom software. But due to D365 running in the background and users being used to terms and certain ways of talking about orders, many of the D365 native wordings for example where left into the custom program. We also had to compromise with some of the processes, which could've been made more efficient, but had to be done in a certain order so D365 could handle them. The final product became a clear improvement from the original AX and D365 programs, at least for the specific users. There remain things I would've done differently, but all in all the project was a success. (Prototype image modified to some extent. Colors changed, logo removed and data made anonymous)</p>
